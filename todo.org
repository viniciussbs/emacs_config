** TODO confirm that customizable variables are set using the right function instead of `setq`
** TODO remove projectile files
** TODO remove EAF files
** TODO remove ido files
** TODO maybe remove session files
** TODO organize configuration in sections
** TODO maybe use org-mode to organize setup
** TODO configure .gitignore
** TODO maybe split section EDITOR in EMACS and EDITOR
   What is the boundary between Emacs' configs and a regular editor.
   Where should I put configs for dired-mode or which-key mode?
   Maybe if a setting will help me better edit a buffer, then it's an editor setting. If will help me better use Emacs, than it's an Emacs config - like dired config?
** TODO use `no-littering` to organize files/settings generated by other packages
